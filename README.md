# Hey there, I'm Mariana! 👩‍💻🎨

## About Me
Hey, I'm Mari, a 22-year-old Brazilian with a passion for web development and a love for art. 🚀 When I'm not coding, you can find me surrounded by my furry friends – 2 dogs and 4 cats. 🐶🐱 In my free time, I enjoy watching old movies, reading, creating cartoon illustrations, and dancing. I used to be part of a dance company called Kahal, where I honed my skills and found joy in the art of movement. 💃
